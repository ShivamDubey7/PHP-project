# PHP-project
trying my hands out on PHP, and hosting them on bluemix.

This is a simple application developed inorder to gain and improve skills for handling PHP servers.
It is based on junior grade maths to solve linear euations int two variables. The step by step procedure is shown to the user in order to accomplish the educaive target for this webapp.
The user is required to enter the two equations to solve, basically the 2 lines whose intersection should be calculated.
Input is in the form of a,b,c for both the lines.<br/>
Depending on the types of lines entered, there can be three cases - 
<ul><li>Single point of intersection, unique solution.</li>
  <li>Both are same lines with constants multiplied, thus infinite solutions.</li>
  <li>Parallel lines, thus no solution.</li>
  </ul>
User gets to know about all the cases, thus learns to predict the case depending on the type of equations.
